# The hidden or lost wisdom of programming

+ Hidden because the wisdom if programming in not openly seen by people you have to find
Standard examples of programming of each language often leads to mess

+ Lost because sometimes this wisdom got lost and was not passed over to the next generation
Younger people are pride because they know so much about new technology so that they do not
listen to older generation you understand all the mistakes they did and new what is really
and want leads to mess

+ Examples of list wisdom - LISP (Arc), Plan9, (Oberon) Pascal, THI, ...

+ Before we got fast hardware people in the early day of computing know how the hardware works and how to make things fast
  This was necessary because otherwise the programm would be to slow. Today we have very fast hardware and still slow software.

## Examples

+ Storing xy coordinates also list x y x y .. x y instead of creating a class Point2D (Performance)
+ ObjectWithAttributes - No normal class - see Maya
